### Request Format:

```
I want to set up orchestration between my [SERVER 1] and [SERVER 2] MCP servers.

**Current Servers:**
- Server 1: [name] - Status: [Working / Needs fixes]
- Server 2: [name] - Status: [Working / Needs fixes]

**Orchestration Goal:**
[Describe the high-level workflow you want to achieve]

**Specific Use Cases:**
1. **Use Case 1 Name**: [Brief description]
   - Expected workflow: [Step by step what should happen]
   - Example command: "[Natural language command to trigger this]"

2. **Use Case 2 Name**: [Brief description]
   - Expected workflow: [Step by step]
   - Example command: "[Natural language command]"

**Questions:**
- Do both servers need updates to work together? [Yes/No/Not sure]
- Are there specific tool improvements needed? [Describe if any]
- Do you need help testing the orchestration? [Yes/No]
```

### Example (Fivetran + Snowflake):

```
I want to set up orchestration between my Fivetran and Snowflake MCP servers.

**Current Servers:**
- Server 1: Fivetran MCP Server - Status: Working
- Server 2: Snowflake MCP Server - Status: Needs to be installed and configured

**Orchestration Goal:**
Enable end-to-end data pipeline monitoring and management without leaving Claude Desktop. Never need to open Fivetran or Snowflake UIs.

**Specific Use Cases:**

1. **Data Quality Check**: 
   - Expected workflow:
     1. Check Fivetran sync status for Salesforce connection
     2. Get last sync time and row counts from Fivetran
     3. Query Snowflake for Salesforce table row counts
     4. Compare Fivetran metrics with Snowflake data
     5. Alert if discrepancies found
   - Example command: "What's my data quality looking like for Salesforce?"

2. **New Source Onboarding**:
   - Expected workflow:
     1. Monitor Fivetran PostgreSQL connection sync status
     2. Wait for initial sync completion
     3. Query Snowflake to inspect new table schemas
     4. Create Snowflake view joining new data with existing tables
     5. Confirm view creation and show sample results
   - Example command: "We just connected PostgreSQL in Fivetran. Once sync completes, create a view joining it with customer data."

3. **Performance Troubleshooting**:
   - Expected workflow:
     1. Check all Fivetran connection sync statuses
     2. Identify any delays or paused connections
     3. Query Snowflake for table last update times
     4. Check Snowflake for long-running queries
     5. Synthesize findings with specific recommendations
   - Example command: "Our dashboard shows stale data. Figure out where the bottleneck is."

4. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Expected workflow:
     1. List all Fivetran connectors with sync frequencies
     2. Query Snowflake usage views for data ingestion by schema
     3. Check Snowflake warehouse credit consumption during sync times
     4. Provide actionable recommendations
   - Example command: "Which Fivetran connectors sync the most data and how much Snowflake compute do they use?"

**Questions:**
- Do both servers need updates to work together? Not sure - Snowflake server isn't set up yet
- Are there specific tool improvements needed? Maybe - need to evaluate once Snowflake is working
- Do you need help testing the orchestration? Yes, definitely want to test each use case
```

## üåê Workflow 4: Multi-Server Ecosystem (3+ Servers)

**Use this when:** You want to orchestrate three or more MCP servers together.

### Request Format:

```
I want to build a multi-server ecosystem with [NUMBER] MCP servers.

**Servers to Include:**
1. [Server 1 name] - Status: [Working/Not started/In progress]
2. [Server 2 name] - Status: [Working/Not started/In progress]
3. [Server 3 name] - Status: [Working/Not started/In progress]
[Add more as needed]

**Ecosystem Goal:**
[Describe the comprehensive workflow/capability you want]

**Complex Use Cases:**
[Describe 2-3 advanced workflows that require all servers]

**Priority:**
Which servers/use cases should we tackle first?
1. [First priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

### Example (Fivetran + Snowflake + dbt + Slack):

```
I want to build a multi-server ecosystem with 4 MCP servers.

**Servers to Include:**
1. Fivetran MCP Server - Status: Working (53 tools)
2. Snowflake MCP Server - Status: Not started (next priority)
3. dbt MCP Server - Status: Not started
4. Slack MCP Server - Status: Not started

**Ecosystem Goal:**
Complete data stack automation - from ingestion through transformation to monitoring and alerting, all through natural language commands in Claude Desktop.

**Complex Use Cases:**

1. **Automated Data Pipeline Deployment**:
   - Deploy new dbt models to production
   - Trigger Fivetran schema refresh for affected sources
   - Wait for sync completion
   - Run dbt transformation
   - Validate results in Snowflake
   - Post success/failure to Slack channel

2. **Proactive Issue Detection**:
   - Monitor Fivetran sync health every hour
   - Check Snowflake query performance
   - Identify dbt models with long run times
   - Alert team in Slack if issues detected
   - Provide diagnostic details and suggested fixes

3. **End-to-End Impact Analysis**:
   - "What happens if I pause the Salesforce connector?"
   - Show affected Snowflake tables
   - Identify dependent dbt models
   - List downstream dashboards/reports
   - Estimate data freshness impact

**Priority:**
1. Get Snowflake MCP server working first
2. Build Fivetran + Snowflake orchestration (prove the concept)
3. Add dbt server and 3-way orchestration
4. Add Slack for notifications (enhancement)
```
